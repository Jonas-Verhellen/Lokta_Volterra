# Lokta_Volterra

The Lotka–Volterra equations, which are also known as the predator–prey equations, are a pair of first-order nonlinear differential equations that describe a biological systems in which two species interact as a predator and prey.

This repo contains a julia embedding of an ODE (ordinary differential equation) into a neural network. Based on the example given in https://julialang.org/blog/2019/01/fluxdiffeq. Here, we expand the code to find the parameters giving rise to a cosine solution.

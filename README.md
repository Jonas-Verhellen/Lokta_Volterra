# Lokta_Volterra

The Lotka–Volterra equations, which are also known as the predator–prey equations, are a pair of first-order nonlinear differential equations that describe the population dynamics of a biological system in which two species interact as a predator and prey.

This repo contains an embedding of a set of ordinary differential equations into a neural network. The code is based of the example given in https://julialang.org/blog/2019/01/fluxdiffeq. Here, we extend the code's functionality to find the parameters that give rise to the cosine solution of the Lotka–Volterra equations.
